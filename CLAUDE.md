## Project: Płomień Kostrze — monorepo conventions

This repo is a **monorepo** holding two architecturally decoupled applications that
share one set of agents, skills, and foundation context.

### Layout

```
plomienkostrze/            # repo root — shared tooling + context
├── .claude/               # skills + settings (shared; gitignored, managed by 10x-cli)
├── .agents/               # agents (shared; gitignored, managed by 10x-cli)
├── CLAUDE.md              # this file
├── context/foundation/    # prd.md, tech-stack.md (frontend), tech-stack-backend.md
├── frontend/              # Angular SPA — TypeScript; own package.json, angular.json
└── backend/               # Spring Boot API — Java; own pom.xml
```

### Boundary rules

- **Decoupling is the HTTP/REST API contract, not the repo split.** `frontend/` and
  `backend/` share no code; they communicate only over the backend's HTTP API. The
  same API is what future Android/iOS apps will consume.
- **Each app owns its own toolchain.** Angular (npm) under `frontend/`, Spring Boot
  (Maven) under `backend/`. Don't hoist one app's build config to the root.
- **Shared, root-level only:** agents, skills, `context/` foundation, this `CLAUDE.md`.
  Agents/skills are shared by virtue of one working directory (they're gitignored, not
  Git-tracked). Optional per-app `frontend/CLAUDE.md` / `backend/CLAUDE.md` may carry
  app-specific conventions.

### Build, deploy, CI

- **Deploy:** Google Cloud (`europe-central2`) — backend on **Cloud Run** (containerized,
  `backend/Dockerfile`), frontend SPA on **Firebase Hosting**, database on **Cloud SQL
  for PostgreSQL**. Runbook: `context/changes/deployment/deployment-plan.md`.
- **CI:** GitHub Actions with **path-filtered** workflows — the frontend job triggers
  on `frontend/**`, the backend job on `backend/**` — and **automatic deploy on merge
  to `master`** (changed 2026-07-04, was manual promotion; PR review + merge is the
  human gate, PRs run build+test only).

### Stack hand-offs

- `context/foundation/tech-stack.md` — frontend (`angular`), canonical.
- `context/foundation/tech-stack-backend.md` — backend (`spring`).
- Both apps are already scaffolded: Angular in `frontend/`, Spring Boot in `backend/`.
  Toolchains are pinned per app — `frontend/.nvmrc` (Node 24.18.0), `backend/.sdkmanrc`
  (Java 21); the backend build needs a JDK, not just a JRE. Bootstrap verification logs
  live in `context/changes/bootstrap-verification/` (`verification.md` frontend,
  `verification-v2.md` backend).

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 3

Review AI-generated code before merge with the **implementation review chain**:

```
/10x-implement -> /10x-impl-review -> triage -> (/10x-lesson | fix | skip | disagree)
```

`/10x-impl-review` is the lesson focus. Review is a quality gate, not an instruction to fix every finding.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Code review (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-impl-review <change-id>` | You have implemented code and want a structured review before merge. The skill checks plan adherence, scope discipline, safety and quality, architecture, pattern consistency, and success criteria, then presents findings for triage. |
| **Recurring lesson outcome** | |
| `/10x-lesson` | A finding reveals a recurring project rule or agent failure pattern. Record it in `context/foundation/lessons.md` instead of treating it as a one-off note. |

### Triage discipline

- Severity says how bad the finding is. Impact says how much the decision matters now.
- Valid outcomes: fix now, fix differently, skip, accept as risk, record as recurring rule (`/10x-lesson`), disagree.
- Fix critical findings. Do not burn hours on low-impact observations just because the agent found them.
- Conscious skipping of low-impact findings is a valid review outcome, not negligence.
- If you disagree with a finding, record why. Wrong agent reasoning is also signal.

### Review boundaries

- This lesson reviews implemented code. It does not create the plan, execute new phases, or teach CI review.
- Testing strategy and quality gates are introduced in Module 3.
- Do not use `/10x-contract` as a triage outcome in this lesson.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - expected implementation contract
- `context/changes/<change-id>/reviews/` - review output
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring lessons

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
